🌍 Visualizing Carbon Emissions Across Sectors (Power BI Dashboard)

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **Power BI** can be used to transform complex carbon emission data into meaningful, interactive dashboards. By analyzing carbon footprints across various **sectors**, **countries**, and **years (2019–2023)**, the project helps users understand emission patterns and support data-driven environmental decisions.


✅ Objectives

- Analyze carbon emissions by country, sector, and year  
- Identify top contributors to global carbon emissions  
- Track trends and changes in emissions from 2019 to 2023  
- Simplify large datasets using interactive data visualizations  
- Support awareness and policy development with clear insights  


🛠 Tools and Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop** – For creating dashboards and visualizations  
- **Microsoft Excel** – For data preparation and cleaning  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – For calculated fields and measures  
- **Data Sources:**  
  - `India_Carbon_Emission.csv`  
  - `summary_of_carbon_emission.xlsx`


📊 Dashboard Features

- Bar Charts, Pie Charts, Line Graphs, Tree Maps, and Tables  
- Interactive filters and slicers for year, sector, and country  
- Clear, insightful visuals for better understanding of emissions  
- Relationships modeled between different datasets for seamless analysis


🏁 Conclusion

This project highlights the power of **data visualization** in making environmental data accessible and actionable. With Power BI, users can gain deep insights into emission trends and make informed decisions for a sustainable future.
